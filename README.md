# Install

## Prerequisite 

You will need to have installed the [Starship.rs](https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation) command line prompt decorator

## Local Installation

After you have installed Startship.rs put the `starship.toml` file in your `~/.config` directory, render a new prompt `Ctrl\CMD+C` and you should see your new promt.

To get the XX Rose background image to render, I am using the Windows Terminal and made that change in the settings.

**Note:** You will most likely need to install a Nerd Font to get the Unicode Characters to render. I am using the MesloLGS NF fonts found in the [Powerlevel10K](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#fonts) github repo

You don't have to install PowerLevel10K just grab the 4 font packs from there. (Screen shot below)

Then make sure to change the font in your terminal settings.
